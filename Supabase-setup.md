# Setting Up Supabase with Google Authentication

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Supabase and configuring Google as an authentication provider for your application.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account and project.
- A Google Cloud account.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development.

## Step 1: Set Up Supabase

1. **Create a Supabase Project:**

   - Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.io) and sign in.
   - Click on "New Project" and fill in the necessary details to create your project.

2. **Configure Database:**
   - Once your project is created, navigate to the "Database" section.
   - Set up your database schema as needed for your application.

## Step 2: Configure Google Cloud

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project:**

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Click on the project dropdown and select "New Project."
   - Enter a name for your project and click "Create."

2. **Enable OAuth Consent Screen:**

   - In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen."
   - Select "External" and fill in the required fields.
   - Save and continue through the setup process.

3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."
   - Click on "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID."
   - Choose "Web application" as the application type.
   - Add your authorized redirect URIs. For Supabase, this typically includes:
     - `https://<your-supabase-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - Click "Create" and note down the Client ID and Client Secret.

## Step 3: Configure Supabase Authentication

1. **Access Supabase Authentication Settings:**

   - In your Supabase project, navigate to the "Authentication" section.

2. **Enable Google Provider:**

   - Under "Providers," find Google and toggle it on.
   - Enter the Client ID and Client Secret obtained from the Google Cloud Console.

3. **Save Changes:**
   - Ensure all changes are saved.

## Step 4: Implement Authentication in Your Application

1. **Install Supabase Client:**

   - If you haven't already, install the Supabase client in your application:
     ```bash
     npm install @supabase/supabase-js
     ```

2. **Initialize Supabase Client:**

   - In your application, initialize the Supabase client with your project's URL and public API key:

     ```javascript
     import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

     const supabaseUrl = "https://<your-supabase-project>.supabase.co";
     const supabaseAnonKey = "<your-anon-key>";

     const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
     ```

3. **Implement Google Sign-In:**

   - Use the Supabase client to handle Google sign-in:

     ```javascript
     const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
       provider: "google",
     });

     if (error) {
       console.error("Error signing in:", error.message);
     } else {
       console.log("User signed in:", user);
     }
     ```

## Conclusion

You have now set up Supabase with Google as an authentication provider. You can further customize your authentication flow and integrate it into your application as needed. For more detailed information, refer to the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.io/docs) and [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs).
